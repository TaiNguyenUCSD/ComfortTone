		Hello! I'm Tai, and I'm super excited about music and all the super 
		cool things that people can do with it. I love playing the piano and 
		guitar and love making acappella covers of pentatonix songs. In my free
		time, I also like to play video games like Persona 5 and learn more about Physics!
